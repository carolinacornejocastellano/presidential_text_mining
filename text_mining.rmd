## Introduction

This is a project to explore the priorities of Peruvian governments in the last decade. The data used is the presidential inauguration speeches of the last decade. The speeches are available in the website of the Peruvian Congress. The speeches are in Spanish, so I used Google Translate to translate them to English. The speeches are available in the folder "data".
